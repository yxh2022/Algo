Given a target integer T and an integer array A, A is sorted in ascending order first, then shifted by an arbitrary number of positions.

For Example, A = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2} (shifted left by 2 positions). Find the index i such that A[i] == T or return -1 if there is no such index.

Assumptions: There could be duplicate elements in the array.
Return the smallest index if target has multiple occurrence.
